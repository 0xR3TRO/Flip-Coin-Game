## Project Description

### Goal:

The "Flip Coin Game" project aims to provide users with an interactive browser-based game that allows them to bet on the result of a coin toss and keep track of their scores. The application should be simple, fast, and intuitive, encouraging users to enjoy quick, entertaining gaming sessions.

### Features:

- **Coin Toss:** Users can bet on whether the coin will land on "Heads" or "Tails".
- **Score Tracking:** The application counts and displays statistics of wins and losses.
- **Toss History:** Users can view the history of previous coin tosses.
- **Sharing Results:** Users can share their results on social media platforms.

## Requirements Analysis:

### Functional Requirements:

- **Coin Toss:** Users can select "Heads" or "Tails" before each toss.
- **Score Tracking:** The application counts wins and losses in real-time.
- **Toss History:** The application stores and displays the history of coin tosses, allowing users to review results.
- **Sharing Results:** Users can share their results on social media platforms.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

- **Responsiveness:** The application should run smoothly and quickly, without delays.
- **User Interface:** A friendly, intuitive interface that is easy to understand and use.
- **Scalability:** The application should support multiple users simultaneously without losing performance.

## User Interface Design:

### Sketches/Visualizations:

- _Home Page:_ A welcome screen with a "Start Game" button and a preview of the user's statistics.
- _Game Window:_ A screen with "Heads" and "Tails" buttons, and a section displaying the result of the last toss.
- _Toss History:_ A list showing the results of previous tosses with dates and times.

### Site Map:

- _Home Page_
  - "Start Game" and "Toss History" buttons
  - Win/Loss statistics
- _Game Window_
  - "Heads" and "Tails" buttons
  - Last toss result
- _Toss History_
  - List of toss results

## System Architecture:

### Data Structure Description:

The application stores data related to coin tosses, including:

- **Toss Parameters:** Information about the userâ€™s choice (Heads/Tails).
- **Results:** Records of toss results with dates and times.
- **Statistics:** Count of wins and losses.

### Architecture Diagrams:

The architecture is based on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) model, where:

- **Model:** Handles game logic and data management.
- **View:** Presents the user interface.
- **Controller:** Manages communication between the model and the view.

## Implementation:

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js).
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express.js).
- **Database:** MongoDB (for storing toss data and statistics).

### Code Structure:

- _Directories/Files_: Separate files for game logic, interface, data management.
- _Coding Style_: Use of modularity, readability, and comments in the code.

## Testing:

### Test Plan:

- **Unit Tests:** Check the correctness of toss and score-tracking functions.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure that components work together correctly.
- **User Interface Tests:** Verify user interactions on different devices.
- **Performance Tests:** Evaluate application performance under high user load.

### Testing Procedures:

- Develop a set of test cases for each application function.
- Establish procedures for reporting and fixing identified bugs.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment Stages:** Testing, bug fixes, release on platforms accessible to users.
- **Timeline:** Define dates for each planned stage.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Establish communication channels for users to report issues.
- **Updates:** Plan regular updates based on user needs and feedback.

## Schedule:

### Project Plan:

- **Implementation Stages:** Break down work into specific tasks (e.g., game mechanics implementation, interface design, testing).
- **Timeline:** Determine the time needed for each stage.

## Budget:

### Estimated Costs:

- **Application Development:** Based on developer hours or team.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Servers, possible external service fees, technical support.
